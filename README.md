# Minimal example for Bug

When the node inspector module is used in a renderer process it crashes the process with a failed assertion. This code is at the top of preload.js and causes the render process to crash immediately upon starting. 
```
const inspector = require('inspector');
const session = new inspector.Session();
session.connect();  //!!! crash: ... Assertion `(client_) != nullptr' failed.
``` 

This is the error
```
../../third_party/electron_node/src/inspector_agent.cc:824:std::unique_ptr<InspectorSession> node::inspector::Agent::Connect(std::unique_ptr<InspectorSessionDelegate>, bool): Assertion `(client_) != nullptr' failed.
```

I came across this bug when I created a node repl in the renderer process that uses the tty device of the launching terminal.  If you
comment out the session.connect() line at the top of preload.js the repl will run and work properly until you press tab on the fist
word where the completion function uses inspector to get the names of the lexical scoped 'global' variables available to the repl.







# electron-quick-start

**Clone and run for a quick way to see Electron in action.**

This is a minimal Electron application based on the [Quick Start Guide](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/quick-start) within the Electron documentation.

**Use this app along with the [Electron API Demos](https://electronjs.org/#get-started) app for API code examples to help you get started.**

A basic Electron application needs just these files:

- `package.json` - Points to the app's main file and lists its details and dependencies.
- `main.js` - Starts the app and creates a browser window to render HTML. This is the app's **main process**.
- `index.html` - A web page to render. This is the app's **renderer process**.

You can learn more about each of these components within the [Quick Start Guide](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/quick-start).

## To Use

To clone and run this repository you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start
# Go into the repository
cd electron-quick-start
# Install dependencies
npm install
# Run the app
npm start
```

Note: If you're using Linux Bash for Windows, [see this guide](https://www.howtogeek.com/261575/how-to-run-graphical-linux-desktop-applications-from-windows-10s-bash-shell/) or use `node` from the command prompt.
